            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Art of Seeing is my way of being present, awakening the senses, living within the poetics and creativity of the moment and to share with the world - be they family, friends or clients - a perspective I have earned and learned to see by stumbling, falling and picking myself up again. Let us be kind and compassionate in all that we do. I hope my offering is received well by you, my friends and companions. </p>]]></description>
